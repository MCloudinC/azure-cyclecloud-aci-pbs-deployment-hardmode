# 🚀 Migration Guide: v2.0 → v2.1 Multi-Stage Workflows

## 📋 Overview

Version 2.1 introduces **multi-stage GitHub Actions workflows** that dramatically improve reliability, debugging capability, and user experience while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

## 🆕 What Changed

### **Workflow Architecture: Monolithic → Multi-Stage**

#### **Before (v2.0): Single Job**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-cyclecloud-mcr:    # One massive job
    steps:                  # 13 sequential steps
      - validate            # Mixed with deployment
      - deploy              # All-or-nothing execution
      - report              # Hard to debug failures
```

#### **After (v2.1): Multi-Stage**
```yaml  
jobs:
  validate-prerequisites:   # Stage 1: Fast validation
  plan-deployment:         # Stage 2: Smart planning  
  deploy-container:        # Stage 3: Conditional deployment
  generate-outputs:        # Stage 4: Rich reporting
```

### **Key Improvements**

| Aspect | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|--------|------|------|
| **Architecture** | Single 666-line job | 4 focused stages |
| **Error Isolation** | ❌ Hard to debug | ✅ Know exact failure point |
| **Restart Capability** | ❌ All-or-nothing | ✅ Resume from failure |
| **Deployment Logic** | ❌ Always deploy | ✅ Smart decisions |
| **Error Messages** | ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific fix instructions |
| **Validation Speed** | ❌ 15 min to find config error | ✅ 2 min fast-fail |
| **Retry Logic** | ❌ Single attempt | ✅ Up to 3 retries |

✅ **Same outputs**: Artifacts and functionality maintained
✅ **Same infrastructure**: Deploys identical resources  
✅ **Same secrets/variables**: GitHub configuration unchanged

### **Step 3: Enhanced Features Available**
🆕 **Multi-stage progress**: See exactly which stage is running  
🆕 **Smart deployment modes**: Passive/Update/Forced options
🆕 **Better error messages**: Specific instructions for fixes
🆕 **Retry logic**: Automatic retry of failed Azure operations

## 🎯 Multi-Stage Workflow Deep Dive

### **Workflow 1: Deploy CycleCloud (4 Stages)**

#### **Stage 1: Validate Prerequisites** ⚡ (~2 minutes)
**Purpose**: Fast-fail validation before expensive operations

**What it checks**:
- ✅ GitHub repository variables configured
- ✅ Azure service principal access  
- ✅ Resource group exists and accessible
- ✅ VNet and subnet configuration
- ✅ Subnet delegation for containers

**Benefits**:
- **Fast feedback**: Know about configuration issues in 2 minutes
- **Clear errors**: Specific instructions for missing variables  
- **No wasted time**: Don't start 15-minute deployment if config is wrong

**Example output**:
```bash
✅ Configuration validation passed
  Resource Group: RG-BH_HPC_Cloud_Azure-NP-SUB-000005-EastUS-dev  
  Region: eastus
  VNet: hpc-vnet (RG: RG-Networking)
  Subnet: cyclecloud-subnet
  Subnet ID: /subscriptions/.../subnets/cyclecloud-subnet
```

#### **Stage 2: Plan Deployment** 📋 (~1 minute)  
**Purpose**: Discover images and determine smart deployment strategy

**What it does**:
- 🔍 **Discovers available CycleCloud images** from Microsoft Container Registry
- 🧠 **Intelligent tag selection** based on mode and availability
- 📊 **Checks existing container state** and health  
- 🎯 **Plans deployment action** based on mode and current state

**Smart deployment decisions**:

| Mode | Existing Container | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| `passive` | Healthy & Running | ⏭️ **Skip** | Don't disturb working system |
| `passive` | Missing/Failed | 🚀 **Deploy** | Need working container |
| `update` | Same version | ⏭️ **Skip** | Already on target version |
| `update` | Older version | 🔄 **Update** | Newer version available |
| `forced` | Any state | 🚀 **Replace** | User requested replacement |

**Example output**:
```bash  
📋 Deployment Plan:
  Mode: update
  Action: skip
  Reason: Update mode: already on target tag 8.3.1
  Will deploy: false
  Will delete existing: false
```

#### **Stage 3: Deploy Container** 🚀 (~10-15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Actually deploy Azure Container Instance (only if needed)

**Conditional execution**: Only runs if Stage 2 determined deployment is needed

**Enhanced features**:
- 🔄 **Retry logic**: Up to 3 attempts with 30-second delays
- 🧹 **Cleanup**: Handles deletion of existing containers when needed
- ⏱️ **Timeout handling**: Waits for container ready state
- 🔍 **Verification**: Confirms final deployment status

**Example retry logic**:
```bash
Deployment attempt 1/3...
::warning::Deployment attempt 1 failed, retrying in 30 seconds...
Deployment attempt 2/3...
✅ Container deployed successfully on attempt 2
```

#### **Stage 4: Generate Outputs** 📊 (~1 minute)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive reports and artifacts

**Always runs**: Even if deployment was skipped

**Outputs created**:
- 📋 **Deployment report**: Full configuration and status
- 🔗 **Access instructions**: Private IP, URLs, credentials  
- ⚙️ **Management commands**: Ready-to-run Azure CLI commands
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions
- 📥 **Downloadable artifacts**: For offline reference

**Example deployment report**:
```markdown
# CycleCloud Deployment Report

## Status: ✅ Deployed Successfully

### Configuration  
- Container: cyclecloud-mcr
- Resource Group: RG-BH_HPC_Cloud_Azure-NP-SUB-000005-EastUS-dev
- Image Tag: 8.3.1
- Private IP: 10.0.1.4

### Access Information  
⚠️ Private Network Only - Requires VPN/Bastion/Jump Box
- CycleCloud Web UI: http://10.0.1.4:8080

### Next Steps
1. Connect to your VNet (VPN, Bastion, or Jump Box)  
2. Access CycleCloud UI at the private IP above
3. Run Workflow 2 to create PBS Pro cluster
```

## 🔍 Debugging Improvements

### **Before v2.1: Hard to Debug**
```bash
❌ Single job failed somewhere in 666 lines
   └── Could be validation, deployment, or reporting
   └── Had to re-read entire log to find issue
   └── Restart meant re-running everything
```

### **After v2.1: Easy to Debug**
```bash
✅ Stage 1: Validate Prerequisites - SUCCESS (2 min)
✅ Stage 2: Plan Deployment - SUCCESS (1 min) 
❌ Stage 3: Deploy Container - FAILED (5 min)
⏭️ Stage 4: Generate Outputs - SKIPPED

Clear failure isolation:
└── Issue is in deployment, not validation or planning
└── Check Azure quota, subnet delegation, or NSG rules  
└── Fix issue and rerun - Stages 1-2 will skip automatically
```

### **Stage-Specific Troubleshooting**

#### **Stage 1 Failures**: Configuration Issues
```bash
❌ Stage 1: Repository variable RESOURCE_GROUP is required
Fix: Go to Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions → Variables
     Add variable: RESOURCE_GROUP = your-resource-group-name
```

#### **Stage 2 Failures**: Image/Planning Issues  
```bash
❌ Stage 2: Tag 'latest' not found in registry
Fix: Specify concrete tag like '8.3.1' or check MCR connectivity
```

#### **Stage 3 Failures**: Azure Deployment Issues
```bash
❌ Stage 3: Container deployment failed after 3 attempts
Common causes:
- Service principal lacks Microsoft.ContainerInstance/* permissions  
- Subnet delegation not configured for containers
- Network security group blocking container traffic
- Azure quota limits reached in region eastus
```

## 🎛️ Enhanced Deployment Modes

### **Passive Mode** (New Smart Behavior)
**Use case**: Check if deployment is needed without making changes

```yaml
deployment_mode: passive
```

**Behavior**:
- ✅ **Healthy container exists**: Skip deployment, generate report
- ❌ **No container or unhealthy**: Deploy new container  
- ⚡ **Fast completion**: ~3 minutes if skipped, ~15 minutes if deployed

### **Update Mode** (Enhanced Logic)
**Use case**: Deploy only if newer version available

```yaml  
deployment_mode: update
```

**Behavior**:
- 🔍 **Compares versions**: Current vs available in registry
- ✅ **Same version**: Skip deployment
- 🆕 **Newer available**: Replace with latest
- 🔄 **Intelligent updates**: Don't disturb if already current

### **Forced Mode** (Improved Reliability)  
**Use case**: Always replace existing container

```yaml
deployment_mode: forced
```

**Behavior**:
- 🚀 **Always deploys**: Regardless of existing state
- 🧹 **Clean replacement**: Properly deletes existing first
- 🔄 **Retry logic**: Up to 3 attempts if failures occur
- ✅ **Guaranteed fresh**: New container with latest settings

---

## 🔧 Backward Compatibility

### **100% Compatible Inputs**
All existing workflow parameters work unchanged:

```yaml
# v2.0 parameters work identically in v2.1:
environment: RG-BH_HPC_Cloud_Azure-NP-SUB-000005-EastUS-dev
